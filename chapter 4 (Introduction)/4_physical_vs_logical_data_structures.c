//Types of Data Structures:-
//(1)Physical Data Structures                   (2)Logical Data Structures

//(1)Physical Data Structures:-     --> how the memory allocates 
//(i)Array      ---> can be allocated both as in stack and heap & used when you are sure in use of size
//
//(ii)Linked list       ---> always created in heap & size can be varry


//(2)Logical Data Structures:-
//(i)Stack      (ii)Queues      (iii)Trees      (iv)Graph       (v)Hash Table

//Logical Data Structures implemented by using physical data structures
